## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or later)
* `npm` or `yarn`

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/smart25-website.git](https://github.com/your-username/smart25-website.git)
    cd smart25-website
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Environment Variables

The contact form requires API keys from EmailJS to function.

1.  Create a new file in the root of the project named `.env.local`.
2.  Add your EmailJS credentials to this file:

    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=YOUR_SERVICE_ID
    NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID
    NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the local development server, run:

```
npm run dev
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.
```
### Building for Production

To create an optimized production build of the site:

```
